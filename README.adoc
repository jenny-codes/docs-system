= Docs system template

Tools and config files to quickly build a docs/notes system with https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and automatically publish on https://pages.github.com/[GitHub pages] using https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub actions].

On the development side, it features

* Live reloading
* Docker environment to get it going in 5 minutes.

To me, the greatest pleasure (and where most of the time is spent) in this project is setting up live reloading mechanism and the Docker environment. It's a lot of fun piecing things together.

It only works for MacOS with Homebrew and Ruby installed :P
